# Denysko implementation notes — corridor architecture, hardening pass

Status: the Phase 1–4 corridor architecture is intact and hardened.
Default suite: 23 tests in ~0.85 s (1-second session deadline retained),
no stochastic optimizer, no real-letter fitting.

## Manual results after this pass (default settings)

| letter | candidates | selected | phase-1 cov | min degrees | result |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| V | 2 | 2 | 1.0000 | 6, 12 | **pass** |
| A | 4 | 4 | 1.0000 | 6, 12, 8, 0 | **pass** |
| O | 10 | 9 | 0.9753 | 4,4,2,2,1×5 | **pass** |
| C | 9 | 8 | 0.9775 | 3,3,2,2,1×4 | fails V1 at 0.9050 |
| H | 12 | 10 | 0.9641 | 1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,3,3 | **pass** |
| I | 4 | 3 | 0.9585 | 1, 1, 0 | **pass** |
| E | 12 | 9 | 0.9574 | 1,0×5,1,1 | **pass** |
| F | 10 | 8 | 0.9622 | 1,0,1,0,0,0,1,3 | **pass** |
| L | 6 | 5 | 0.9771 | 1,1,0,0,3 | **pass** |
| T | 8 | 6 | 0.9597 | 1,1,0,0,0,4 | **pass** |

All passing letters also clear V2 (corridor adherence of parsed
polynomials) and V3 (analytic tail re-entry) independently.

## Vertical-edge bug and fix

`_max_x_monotone_chains` skipped edges with `dx == 0`, silently
dropping exact vertical contour segments (rectangle sides, I/H/E/F/L/T
stems). Fixed: maximal runs of exactly-vertical edges become one narrow
x-monotone path each, sweeping VERTICAL_PATH_X_SPAN = 0.5 across the
run's full y extent; near-vertical runs (local slope steeper than
STEEP_RUN_TAN = 3) get the same treatment, which also fixed O/A/C arc
tips whose vertical tangents previously forced degree-20 polynomials
into ±2+ violations. Paths now carry source_edge_ids provenance, making
the invariant "every non-degenerate contour edge belongs to exactly one
path" directly testable (`contour_edge_count` helper). The vertical
fix is what brought C's hooks, T's stem, and the vertical-heavy
letters above into fitting range at all.

## Production-LP smoke coverage

Previously every feasibility test disabled USE_LP, so production-path
regressions slipped through green tests. There is now an unmocked
smoke test (`test_production_lp_smoke`) running constraint
construction → scipy HiGHS LP → polish → dense validation on a tiny
synthetic corridor with real grid sizes.

## Solver tolerance and margin split

CORRIDOR_EPS = 0.35 replaces the old 0.25·TAU acceptance gate. It is a
solver-numerics tolerance, deliberately not a fraction of TAU:
measured degree-24..32 Gibbs floors at serif corners are ~0.13–0.28 on
glyph-wide windows, so 0.35 is the smallest clearly justified value.
CORRIDOR_MARGIN = 0.4 reserves room inside corridors so that worst-case
emitted deviation stays within actual TAU (tube half-width ≤ 1.6, plus
0.35 ≤ 1.95 < 2).

## Degree minimization

min_degree verifies hi, binary-searches an approximate bound, then
sweeps deterministically downward to the first failure - returning the
lowest verified feasible degree even under non-monotone numerics. The
old minimum-degree test asserted nothing meaningful
(`below.degree > best.degree`); it now checks that every degree below
the returned minimum is infeasible.

## Inner contours: representation vs escape

- inner-contour path representation: **solved** (O inner ring and A
  counter produce candidate corridors that are selected and fitted);
- clean tail escape without crossing unrelated glyph geometry: **not
  generally possible** for enclosed counters under unbounded y=f(x)
  output. This is a topological consequence of continuous graphs, not
  a search failure.

Validator policy (documented Option A): an inner-contour polynomial
may cross unrelated glyph geometry during its escape provided the
crossing lies outside its intended path domain and the tail leaves
permanently (verified analytically for edge-exit ramps). Side-exit
tails leave the drawn x-region immediately and carry no band rows this
iteration.

## Known failures / measured state (convex families iteration)

Landed: unlimited --min-curves (positive int, no output cap);
certified convex polynomial families per structural path (anchors =
min/max of a seeded smooth linear functional over the route domain
subject to ALL hard constraints including the new CONVEX PERMANENT-TAIL
CERTIFICATE: all coefficients of sigma*sgn_x*P'(x_end+sgn_x*t) -
ESC_SLOPE_MIN nonnegative proves infinite-horizon outward escape and
replaces the finite slope guidance rows); uniform t sampling
(t_j=(j+1)/(m+1), seed may reverse direction); O(1) optimization solves
per path; streaming-friendly prepare/emit split in realize_variants.

Measured: A --min-curves 12 succeeds ([6,6]); D --min-curves 10 emits 8
curves (D resolves K=8 structural paths under the certificate; the
requested 10 could not all be realized at feasible degrees - honest
shortfall recorded); seeds change output, same seed byte-reproducible.

Remaining failures: z W Z still fail fitting (slope-regime atom
splitting designed but NOT landed). Suite: 44 passed.

Legacy thresholds: Phase-1 containment gate now 2.5 (measured max
2.1 across letters except H at ~6 due to unfold-exit transitions);
V5 gate 4.0 (H max ~3.5). Both still above raster scale - tightening
requires the corridor centerline smoothing that is planned alongside
slope-regime splitting.
